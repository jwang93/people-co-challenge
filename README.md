Team #NoFilter

Most of the information provided in the Tech Draft application was professional. Applicants provided their grades, test scores, and githup repositories to show their professional background. One of the most important things when it comes to selecting candidates is seeing that they fit the culture of the company. Our project aims at showing the employer what the applicant is like as a person.

The user of our application enters the applicant's instagram handle, and the top hashtags are aggregated. We then google images associated with the applicant's hashtags, and display a collage representing the applicants interests. In a single view, we give a recruiter a sense of the applicant's personality outside of their professional background. 

Using The Application

Enter the applicant's handle, and a collage is returned. In our implementation, we could not yet get images to load and display, but the top hashtags are correctly aggregated.
